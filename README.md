# blind_auction

This is a blind auction program in which you and multiple bidders in the room secretly bid.
It is recommended to pass the computer to the next bidder once you have finished your bid.

The main file is "main.py", and "art.py" is the supplemental file.
This program supports multiple OSes.

Please note: if your program doesn't clear the screen between bids, then please do research into your IDE's options that may be causing this issue.
